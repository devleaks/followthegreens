# Follow the Greens

Follow the greens is a enhancement to airport infrastructure to ease ground operations.

It is an aid for ground movement, to indicate to pilots where and how to circulate on taxiways without ATC communication.

ATC Ground operators will highlight the taxi path the pilot has to follow with center taxiway green lights.
A red line across the taxiway indicates the aircraft has to hold and wait for the red light to clear.
Very much like car traffic lights.
