If it fails to find a network of taxiways, it reports so and terminates.</p> <p>Third, the plugin tries to guess if you are departing or arriving from your position, and prompt for either a ramp name for arrival or a runway for departure. If it guessed wrong for departure/arrival there is a button to switch between the two.</p> <p>To select your destination, first click inside the input text box to set focus there, then you can use UP and DOWN arrow keys to cycle through proposed valid destinations. If you hit a text key or a number key, selection jumps to the first matching destination.</p> <p>Once you selected your destination, if the plugin fails to find a route to your desired destination on the network of taxiways, it says so and unfortunately terminates. The plane must be within 1/4 mile of the taxiway.</p> <p>So if it complains that it cannot find a route to your destination, move a bit closer to taxiway network and try again.</p> <p>Otherwise, you're all set. Just \" Follow the greens \". The plug in will tell you in which direction you should head to reach the first taxiway leg.</p> <p>If you missed a turn, just ask a new \"green path\" and the plugin will re-route you.</p> <p>When reaching a stop bar (red lights across the taxiway), you must stop and ask for clearance. The plugin will prompt you to tell it when you received clearance. Since this plugin does not make any ATC, you have to ask for the clearance yourself to GROUND. Once cleared, simply press the \"Clearance Received\" button and the plug in will light the next leg of green to your destination.</p> <p>A final popup will tell you when you reached your destination.</p> <p>The main Follow the greens window hides itself after a fe seconds. Simply select the menu entry to reveal it again.</p> <p>The orignal Follow the greens system does not have a rabbit running in front of the plane.

I could not create a \"rabbit beacon\" of lights in front of the plane. I currently program the rabbitby turning lights on and off in a flightloop. Making a beacon light managed by x-plane will probably be more durable and efficient (?).</li> </ol> <p>I'd love to place the lights on decorated lines (where X-Plane places its taxiway lights) rather than on taxiway routing network (more \"gross\"). I'm busy smoothing this network of lines to make smoother turns.</p> <p>BTW: With a little hiccup on start (to find your airport and load its network of taxiway) and for route computation and light instanciation, Follow the greens is FPS friendly. Rabbit runs about 2 to 10 times a second, and plane position is adjusted every 10 seconds or so. All these parameters are globals and can be adjusted to your need, preferences, or requirements. You usually taxi at reasonably slow speed, FPS is not as critical as when approaching.</p> <ol> <li>Routing: Sometimes, the \"closest\" taxiway leg is behind you. It is not acceptable for plane to U-Turn to reach it. Plugin uses naive Dijkstra, taking very limited things into account. There is definitively room for improvement there. For exemple, find a route without crossing any runway, rather than the shortest path. The plugin search a connection to taxiways in front of the plane, but if none can be found, you may have to U-turn.</li> </ol> <p>Airport time, wind, and other approach constraints are not taken into consideration.
